# Simulating source light-cones for TianGongSLWG

We are going to create source light-cones by using the images of COSMOS galaxies and the corresponding Simulated SEDs.
The final product is a python function; inputting necessary parameters of the output light cone, one can generate a simulated light cone just by one hit.

## The First Product 
A simulated patch of sky
- 3 x 3 degree^2
- 4 bands 
- ...

## Code Example

Inputs should be the aera of the field of view, which bands we need. Outputs should be fits files and a catalog of all the galaxies we used in the Simulation

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
